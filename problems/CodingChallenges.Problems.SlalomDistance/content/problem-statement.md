You've decided to start slalom skiing. 
In slalom skiing, you start at some location and must ski through a series of gates. 
Each gate is defined by two flags that you must ski through.
For simplicity, the gates will all be vertically aligned to the y-axis, meaning that both points defining each gate will share the same x-coordinate.
You want to be the best, so you are going to write a program to find the fastest path through a series of gates.

Given a series of slalom gates, your program should find the shortest path through those gates.
