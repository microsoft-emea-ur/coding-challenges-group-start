Many services generate huge amounts of data when in operation. 
There is often a need to parse and consolidate that data to understand and improve those services.
One common metric to calculate is the average of the generated data.

Given a set of data as a string of comma separated values (CSVs), write a program to calculate its average value (arithmetic mean).
