An input file for this problem will contain two lines. 
The first line will be two integers, *N* and *M*, the number of machines in the pipeline and number of loads to be processed, respectively. 
The next line of input will contain *N* space-separated integers where the *i*-th integer indicates the time to process a load in the *i*-th machine.

The following bounds apply (except for the simpler example used below):  
1 <= *N* <= 1000  
*N* <= *M* <= 2 * *N*  
Machine load processing times can range from 1 to 100, inclusive.
